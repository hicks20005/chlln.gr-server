When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		</div>

		<ul class="feature-list">
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Challenger services (collectively, the "Service"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</li>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, comments and other materials ("User Content"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at http://chlln.gr/terms.html).</li>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
		<p>We collect the following types of information:</p>

		<h4>Information you provide us directly:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Challenger account.</li>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>When you create a Challenger account, you must provide access credentials by authentication using another service, such as Facebook. If you create your Challenger account by connecting through another service, we may use public information from that connected account to help complete your Challenger profile.</li>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number, bio). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Challenger.</li>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>User Content (e.g., photos, videos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</li>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>Communications between you and Challenger. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Finding your friends on Challenger:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with Challenger accounts either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on Challenger.</li>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Challenger will access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using Challenger.</li>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</li>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Challenger then simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Analytics information:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</li>

		<h4>Cookies and similar technologies:</h4>

			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Device identifiers:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Challenger.</li>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Metadata:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</li>
			<li><i class="icon_pushpin"> </i>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you create a challenge, comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive.</li>
