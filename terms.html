		</ul>

		<h2>General Conditions</h2>
		<ul>
			<ol>1. We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason, without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Challenger account on Profile Settings page by logging into the Service. If we terminate your access to the Service or you use the method detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</ol>
			<ol>2. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.</ol>
			<ol>3. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use ("Updated Terms") from time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</ol>
			<ol>4. We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</ol>
			<ol>5. We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</ol>
			<ol>6. We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</ol>
			<ol>7. You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. You agree that Challenger is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Challenger reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others, including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</ol>
			<ol>8. There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Challenger does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Challenger is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Challenger has not itself provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the Challenger Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</ol>
			<ol>9. You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</ol>
			<ol>10.	We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Challenger's express consent).</ol>
		</ul>

		<h2>Rights</h2>
		<ul>
			<ol>1. Challenger does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to Challenger a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://the-challenger.com/page/privacy, including but not limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5 ("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities, including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</ol>
			<ol>2. Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that Challenger may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</ol>
			<ol>3. You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such.</ol>
			<ol>4. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</ol>
			<ol>5. The Service contains content owned or licensed by Challenger ("Challenger Content"). Challenger Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and Challenger, Challenger owns and retains all rights in the Challenger Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Challenger Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Challenger Content.</ol>
			<ol>6. The Challenger name and logo are trademarks of Challenger, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Challenger. In addition, all page headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of Challenger, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written permission from Challenger.</ol>
			<ol>7. Although it is Challenger's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Challenger reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Challenger, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Challenger encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Challenger is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Challenger will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</ol>
			<ol>8. You agree that Challenger is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the Service. Challenger does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</ol>
			<ol>9. You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Challenger is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Challenger in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Challenger, and Challenger will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.</ol>
			<ol>10. It is Challenger's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Challenger does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Challenger is free to use any such content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</ol>
		</ul>

		<h2>Reporting Copyright and Other IP Violations</h2>
		<ul>
			<ol>1. We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.</ol>
			<ol>2. We provide you with tools to help you protect your intellectual property rights.</ol>
			<ol>3. If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.</ol>
		</ul>

THE CHALLENGER PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS LAWFUL IN ANY PARTICULAR JURISDICTION, AND THE CHALLENGER PARTIES SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM SUCH WARRANTIES.

IN NO EVENT WILL THE CHALLENGER PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY.

		<p>YOU AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT YOU INCUR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES OR INJURIES THAT ARISE OUT OF CHALLENGER'S ACTS OR OMISSIONS, THE DAMAGES, IF ANY, CAUSED TO YOU ARE NOT IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION PREVENTING ANY EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEB SITE, SERVICE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE CHALLENGER PARTIES, AND YOU WILL HAVE NO RIGHTS TO ENJOIN OR RESTRAIN THE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, ADVERTISING, EXHIBITION OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEB SITE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE CHALLENGER PARTIES.</p>

		<p>BY ACCESSING THE SERVICE, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY BE WAIVING RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS THAT ARE AT THIS TIME UNKNOWN OR UNSUSPECTED, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH WAIVER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND, AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE, THE BENEFITS OF SECTION 1542 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF CALIFORNIA, AND ANY SIMILAR LAW OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY, WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."</p>

		<p>CHALLENGER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD PARTIES, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>

		<h2>Indemnification</h2>
		<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at Challenger's request), indemnify and hold the Challenger Parties harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Challenger in the defense of any claim. Challenger reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of Challenger.</p>

		<h2>Arbitration</h2>
		<p>Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Challenger's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); or (2) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, you agree that all disputes between you and Challenger (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Challenger, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration and you and Challenger hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Challenger will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Challenger is a party to the proceeding. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.</p>

		<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Challenger can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Challenger in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.</p>

		<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Challenger account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.</p>

		<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Challenger.</p>

		<h2>Time Limitation on Claims</h2>
		<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Challenger must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>

		<h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
		<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Challenger and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Challenger. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Challenger. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Challenger will be null and void. Challenger may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
